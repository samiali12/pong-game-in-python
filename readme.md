In this project, I will show how to make a simple ping pong game using python programming language.
It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple 2d graphics.
I have used blue rectangle color  to represent player and opponent paddle and circle shape to represent ball.
Player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across the screenâ€™s left or right side. Player use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball.The goal is  player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
